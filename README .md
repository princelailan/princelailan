## 🪄 About Me

🎨 Joseph Onyango, a.k.a. **Prince Lailan**, here to break stereotypes and render bugs powerless with a sprinkle of glitter and a whole lotta code. Think sugar, spice, and 1800+ poems worth of programming magic. I'm not just a dev, I'm the whole developer *kingdom* 👑.

* 🌍 From Kenya, speaking code and vibes fluently.
* 💻 118+ full projects coded on phone + PC. Try me.
* 🧠 49 books written. Most unpublished, all unforgettable.
* 💡 Known to code a full-stack app while sipping tea and singing K-pop.
* 🐣 Certified guidance counselor + Sunday school teacher.
* 💌 Known for replying late but submitting early (yes, I am the paradox).
* 🐇 Theme lover: from bunnies to bubblegum pink chaos.

* 💔 Never been heartbroken. Too busy debugging life.

## 🧠 My Mind = AI + Art + Bible + Bubblegum

* 📖 Devotion meets deployment.
* 🧪 Faith-based full-stack fusion.
* 💫 Can build, teach, debug, and dance. Often all at once.
