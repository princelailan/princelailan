## 🧁 About Me

🎀 Hey there! I'm **Joseph Onyango**, but on the internet streets, they call me **Prince Lailan** – your ✨sassy dev-in-pink✨.

💻 A **Creative Developer** who sees code as art,
📚 A certified **guidance counselor** who once taught high school before coding full-stack web apps from my Samsung A05 😤
👑 Currently slaying it as a student in the **Power Learn Project MERN stack course**, mentoring others, AND building tech empires while sipping chai 🫖.

🗺️ From **Tunyai, Chogoria, Murang'a, Materi Girls** (yes, I survived all that 😅) to the depths of MongoDB indexes – I’ve been everywhere, girl 💅

🌈 With over **118 projects**, **49 books**, and **1,800 poems**, I don’t sleep, I ship. 🛸

## 🌟 Skills & Superpowers

💄 Frontend:

* HTML5 (flawless)
* CSS3 + Tailwind (because plain CSS is too vanilla 💅)
* React + Vite (hot reload = hot vibes)
* Next.js (I bring the future to now)

🧠 Backend:

* Node.js (no cap, I can async while dreaming)
* Express.js (routes smoother than my eyeliner)
* MongoDB (indexes? Aggregations? Let’s party 🎉)

🪄 Tools:

* GitHub + CI/CD (because pushing code is a lifestyle)
* Canva & Figma (I make pixels cry tears of joy 🖌️)
* Python (my comfort snake 🐍)
* Kotlin (for when Android needs to feel cute)
* SQL (because data gotta be datin’)

🛡️ Other:

* AI bot creation 🤖 (Zoom & Google Meet bots that even turn off your cam for you 😎)
* Confess.AI – my anonymous confessions app with GPT characters (therapy, but aesthetic 💕)

## 🎓 Education + Journey

📍 Finished **Chogoria Boys High School**, 2024 — survived KCSE with a **B-** (don’t ask about Math 🙈)
📍 Taught immediately after graduation (role model things 😌)
📍 Joined PLP, and turned every week’s lesson into a **monetized, community-helping project**
📍 Current laptop: **HP ProBook** (finally leveled up from Samsung A05!)

> "Coding is my love language 💘"
