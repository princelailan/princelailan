📌 Fun Facts That Slap
I don’t break — I debug.

I literally coded with a Samsung A05. RESPECT.

Never had a heartbreak. Too booked & blessed 💅

I wrote 49 books. Not drafts. BOOKS.

I remember how I met 36,000+ people. Yuh. Try me.

I take screenshots of Zoom meetings for proof. Bot does it.

🐣 My Motto?
“If it ain’t fancy, it ain’t me.” — Prince Lailan 👑
“I don’t code. I charm the compiler.”
