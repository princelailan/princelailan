## ✨ Who Am I?

> I'm **Joseph Onyango**, also known as **Prince Lailan**, and I turn tech stress into aesthetic progress.

🧠 I'm a 19-year-old *creative developer* & *full-stack engineer* from Kenya  
🖥️ I’m that one dev who literally built 100+ projects **from a Samsung A05** before getting a proper laptop  
📖 I’ve written **49 unpublished books**, **1800+ poems**, and can make code poetic if I wanna  
🪄 I use **code, color, and chaos** to build not just software — but **experiences**  
🐣 I blend church girl peace with Gen Z tech madness — a digital butterfly who can debug blindfolded  
🧳 Been a **teacher, leader, counselor, and community dev**, and I’m just getting started
