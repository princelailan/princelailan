## üß† Who TF is Joseph?

Hey! I'm **Joseph Onyango**, but in these internet streets, you probably know me better as **Prince Lailan**. I‚Äôm a 19-year-old software engineer, visual storyteller, and chaos-loving creative dev from Kenya üá∞üá™. I finished high school in 2024 and decided to skip the boring lane ‚Äî now I build fullstack web apps, stunning UI art, AI-powered tools, and a whole lot of vibes.

Oh and yeah ‚Äî I once built a mindfulness site and forgot to add CSS. It still haunts me at 3AM. üêáüëª
